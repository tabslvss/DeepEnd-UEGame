Researched royalty-free sound effect from Freesound.org
Selected the following audio for specific in game scenarios:
Horror Ambience by Headphaze for general background atmosphere
Ghost Whisper by Litruv - for creepy or monster-like moments
Slow Heartbeat ny klanlbeeld- for high tension during close encounters
Creaky Doors by CastIronCarousel- for environment interaction and suspense
Footsteps by inspectorJ- for when the player is walking or running
Jump Scare Sound by WolfOWI- For scripted scare moments

Motivation:
These sounds were chosen to enhance player immersion and support the horror tone of the game. For example, the horror ambience sound intensifies feelings of uneasiness,giving the game a more spooky and suspenseful vibe. The ghost whisper combined with the heartbeat work together to build tension.While sounds like creaky doors and footsteps add realism and make the environment feel more alive adding to the immersion.
